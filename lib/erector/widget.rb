module Erector
  
  # A Widget is the center of the Erector universe. 
  #
  # To create a widget, extend Erector::Widget and implement the +content+
  # method. Inside this method you may call any of the tag methods like +span+
  # or +p+ to emit HTML/XML tags. 
  #  
  # You can also define a widget on the fly by passing a block to +new+. This
  # block will get executed when the widget's +content+ method is called. See
  # the userguide for important details about the scope of this block when run --
  # http://erector.rubyforge.org/userguide.html#blocks
  #
  # To render a widget from the outside, instantiate it and call its +to_s+
  # method.
  #
  # A widget's +new+ method optionally accepts an options hash. Entries in
  # this hash are converted to instance variables.
  #
  # You can add runtime input checking via the +needs+ macro. See #needs. 
  # This mechanism is meant to ameliorate development-time confusion about
  # exactly what parameters are supported by a given widget, avoiding
  # confusing runtime NilClass errors.
  #  
  # To call one widget from another, inside the parent widget's +content+
  # method, instantiate the child widget and call the +widget+ method. This
  # assures that the same output stream is used, which gives better
  # performance than using +capture+ or +to_s+. It also preserves the
  # indentation and helpers of the enclosing class.
  #  
  # In this documentation we've tried to keep the distinction clear between
  # methods that *emit* text and those that *return* text. "Emit" means that
  # it writes to the output stream; "return" means that it returns a string
  # like a normal method and leaves it up to the caller to emit that string if
  # it wants.
  #
  # Now, seriously, after playing around a bit, go read the user guide. It's 
  # fun!

    # variables -- can be quite confusing. The rule is, most of the time the

    # is that of the caller. So if that caller is not an Erector widget, it
    # will *not* have access to the Erector methods, but it *will* have access
